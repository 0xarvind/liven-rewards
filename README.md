The task is to create a website with the following UI:

![image](https://utfs.io/f/d821c00f-3aa5-47d2-9eb7-aff65af3632b-y75yzs.png)

The website should have the following functionality:

- Redirect to []() when clicked on Logo in the header and footer
- Redirect to []() when clicked on `Get app` button in the header
- Redirect to []() when clicked on the cards.
- When `Purchase as gift` is toggled on `App exlusive` rewards should not be showns

## Tech Stack

I have used the following technologies:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)

I chose to use `nextjs` because it is a framework for building react applications and it was the suggested framework by `React`.

And for the components I have used `antd` because it is a UI library for `react` which is easy to use and has a lot of components.

## Getting Started

Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the application.

You can also visit the [live website](https://liven-rewards-two.vercel.app/) to see the application live.
